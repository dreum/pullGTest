# pullGTest
This is a small example project that can pull gtest from github and include it in your project.

CMake files are slightly modified from examples by  Craig Scott http://crascit.com/2015/07/25/cmake-gtest/

Be sure to modify gtest-CMakeFiles.txt to the version of gtest you are interested in.
